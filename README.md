# Development setup 

A little repo displaying my current development setup. Mainly from a **visual** point of view.
This repo is both _for myself to remember_ (I put a little too much time and effort in this sh*t) and to be able to maybe **inspire** other people on their setup.
And also, _I like geeking-out on this stuff..._
  
> I'm not a designer or a front-end developer, but still like it when the things I look at every day look good.

## Intellij IDE color scheme

**My Current PhpStorm Color Scheme.**

This scheme based on the [Material Theme UI](https://www.material-theme.com/) _Palenight_ color scheme.
I took this as a basis and over some time changed it to my personal liking.

The base color is **darker** than _Palenight_, the yellow more **vibrant**.
The blues are **softer** and more _lilac_, and I added the _pink-ish red_ for some Keywords.

Together with the [Atom Material Icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10044-atom-material-icons/versions/), [Rainbow Brackets](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets) and [Indent Rainbow](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13308-indent-rainbow) plugins, this makes for a _"clean, colorful and not too crowded"_ coding experience. At least... If you try to **disable as much unnecessary views and toolbars as you can**.
