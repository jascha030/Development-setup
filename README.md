# Development setup 

A little repo displaying my current development setup. Mainly from a **visual** point of view.
This repo is both _for myself to remember_ (I put a little too much time and effort in this sh*t) and to be able to maybe **inspire** other people on their setup.
And also, _I like geeking-out on this stuff..._

## Intellij IDE color scheme

**My Current PhpStorm Color Scheme.**

This scheme based on the [Material Theme UI](https://www.material-theme.com/) _Palenight_ color scheme.
I took this as a basis and over some time changed it to my personal liking.

The base color is **darker** than _Palenight_, the yellow more **vibrant**.
The blues are **softer** and more _lilac_, and I added the _pink-ish red_ for some Keywords.

Together with the [Atom Material Icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10044-atom-material-icons/versions/), [Rainbow Brackets](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets) and [Indent Rainbow](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13308-indent-rainbow) plugins, this makes for a _"clean, colorful and not too crowded"_ coding experience. At least... If you try to **disable as much unnecessary views and toolbars as you can**.

## Terminal (iTerm2) profiles

### Main / Hotkey window

![Screenshot of PhpStorm](https://github.com/jascha030/Development-setup/blob/master/Screenshot_iterm_main.png)

My **main** hotkey window, also uses _palenight_ inspired colors and a **clean** look for **focus** and _maximum effectiveness_ (don't quote me on that).


### Feeling frisky window

I for the life of me can't remember where I found that background (somewhere on twitter?), but shout-out to that guy 😅.


### Other specs

As you can see in the images, i'm using the ever so popular **iTerm2** + **Zsh** + **Oh-my-zsh** + **Powerlvl10k** (prev. Powerlvl9k) **Wombo-combo**.
When interested in that **you should probably google that...** There's a **boatload** of people who can explain that stuff a whole lot better than _this rinkeydink Git repo o' mine_.
Also these screenshots just made me realise I have **101** packages installed on **brew**.

<hr>

Speaking of packages

## Make your life better by using

- **Brew** | For all your general purpose **hackerman** business
- **Brew Cask** | For mac **software** / apps
- **Mas** | For downloading actual Mac **Appstore apps**
- **NPM** | Nodejs dependencies (Might cost you a year or two on your life expectency) - apparently Yarn is better, but I'm not too invested
- **Nvm** | Managing Npm versions is a _giant tw*t_ of a task
- **Pyenv** | Managing python versions
- **Composer** | Php packages

> Don't you go strollin' around that dangerous internet clickin' crooked links and straining your beloved fingers. You might get seriously hurt one day...

## Current hardware

To finish it off nicely

- **Macbook Pro** (2017) | 13 Inch | 4 Thunderbolt 3 Ports | 3,1 GHz i5 | 8 GB
- **Keychron K2** (Version 2) | White backlight | Brown switches | For home
- **Apple Magic Keyboard** | When at work 
- **Apple Magic Mouse and Trackpad** | switching between them because I like to pretend it's giving me less strain injury.
- **iiyama ProLite XUB3493WQSU-B1** | Widescreen monitor

> Also 2x KRK Rokit 6 Nearfield monitor speakers | Magnat Vector Sub 30 Aktiv Subwoofer | Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 Audio interface | Not that anyone asked but without some tunes I can't function like a normal human being...
